# Intelligent-Tennis-ball-Collector-Motor-and-sensors-Code
this is the C code for an Intelligent Tennis ball Collector Motor and sensors 
 the full project included :
python ,OpenCV and computer vision algorthms to build robot that can detect balls alone and collect it in real time.
 rasbPI and arduino using a communication protocol 
 Machine learning and Face detection algorithms
inventor and Solidworks and fritzing to build the Robot prototype
MATLAB Simulink and Contact lib to test and simulate the robot 

this is the C module responsible for control of the motors and recieving data from sensors , PID and PWM and sending and recieving commands from high level controller (PI)
